Repo for course taken during undergrad at UofT. CSCB07: Software Design

Assignment 1: In computer graphics, an object is usually represented by dividing its surface into a set of 
polygons (also called faces). Such set is called a mesh. The code given demonstrates a simplistic implementation of face meshes using a simple Java implementation of different polygons.

Assignment 2:

Part 1: Java code demonstrating a rudimentary implementation of Twitter's functions. Implementation allows users to follow one another, post tweets, and display tweets posted by followed users.

Part 2: Java code which allows to find top 3 hashtags used in Tweets by a particular Twitter user. A '.txt' file containing tweets by a particular user needs to be given as input for the program to find the top 3 hashtags.
